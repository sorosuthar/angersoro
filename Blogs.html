            Fast-paced video games like Need For Speed or Call of Duty require
            you to stay on your toes and make decisions quickly. These
            energizing action games can also improve your ability to make
            game-time decisions in real life.When playing strategy games like Civilization
            or SimCity, you have to plan ahead and make decisions now that will
            benefit you down the road. These games train your brain to recognize
            potential outcomes and implications of your choices to make the best
            choices for your desired result. When a person practices these
            skills in a virtual world, they will be able to better apply them in
            the real world.

            <h4>Games can teach you to be a better problem solver.</h4>
            <p>
              Open-world, mission-based, and multi-level games are designed like
              complex puzzles that take several hours to solve. Occasionally,
              the solution varies based on your actions in the game. Learning to
              think on your feet and strategize in a fast-paced fantasy
              environment is a skill that can translate to the real world. One
              long-term study published in 2013 showed that children who played
              strategy-based games showed an improvement in problem-solving
              skills—and thus, tended to get better grades—the next school year.

            <h4>Importance of video games</h4>
            <p>
              Gaming is really a workout for your mind disguised as fun. Studies
              have shown that playing video games regularly may increase gray
              matter in the brain and boost brain connectivity. (Gray matter is
              associated with muscle control, memories, perception, and spatial
              navigation.)Give a boost to creativity: A psychological research
              study by Iowa State University revealed that in some situations,
              video games might help enhance creativity . Creativity is an
              essential skill that lets your child think out of the box.

            <h4>Video games can improve your vision</h4>
            <p>
              As long as you’re not staring at the screen for 10 hours straight
              (or sitting two feet away), playing video games can actually make
              for better vision. In one study, 10 male students who were not
              gamers were trained for 30 hours in first-person action games and
              then tested against 10 non-gamers. The students who played were
              able to see objects more clearly in clutter to train their brains
              to see smaller details, because in each game, those details turned
              out to be important.

            <h4>Memory</h4>
            <p>
              Many video games require some serious strategy and concentration.
              If you have ever built your own civilization in Minecraft or
              fought for your life in Fortnite, you know how important it is to
              remember where you found specific resources or where you need to
              go next. With 3D graphics and immersive audio, video game
              environments are extremely rich in stimuli. Navigating the virtual
              world of video games is now very similar to navigating the real
              world. In fact, exploring video game universes can have a positive
              impact on memory in your everyday life.

            <h4>Spatial Visualization</h4>
            <p>
              On top of improving your spatial memory, playing video games also
              helps you visualize space better. A 2013 study from the American
              Psychological Association showed that shooter video games improve
              how you think about objects in three dimensions. Gamers are better
              at judging distances between objects or mentally rotating objects
              to imagine how they might fit into a space. This enhanced spatial
              visualization has practical benefits, like knowing whether you
              will be able to parallel park in a tight spot or organizing your
              closet, so everything fits. Good spatial visualization is also
              essential for success in many STEM careers.

            <h4>Decision Making</h4>
            <p>
              Fast-paced video games like Need For Speed or Call of Duty require
              you to stay on your toes and make decisions quickly. These
              energizing action games can also improve your ability to make
              game-time decisions in real life. A 2010 study from the University
              of Rochester showed gamers who love action games could make
              accurate choices more quickly than non-gamers or those who play
              slow-paced video games. Their study tested participants in both
              visual and audio decision-making tasks. While all groups performed
              at about the same accuracy, the action gamer group completed the
              tasks up to 25 percent faster.
